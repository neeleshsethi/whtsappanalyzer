Ashwin.
Second innings Rohit pujara and hagrat got out to shots that weren't needed
[6/11/23, 9:36:24 PM] Amod Tilak: The way they were playing yday, could have chased it down even with the fourth innings pressure. Stupid shots from these three
[6/11/23, 9:36:24 PM] Amod Tilak: And finally, missed jassi all the way. Him being there would have given the game a complete different direction

[7/7/23, 10:58:58 AM] Amod Tilak: राजकारणातील ढेकळं न कळणाऱ्या सामान्य माणसाचे सद्य राजकीय परिस्थितीवर केलेले भाष्य.
( मोठा लेख आहे )

राष्ट्रवादी कोन्ग्रेस पक्ष हा मुळातून राजकीय पक्ष नाही. स्वयंप्रकाशी सरंजामदारांनी एका मोठ्या भाईच्या टोळीत जाणे आणि त्या टोळीला राजकीय पक्ष असे नाव देणे.. म्हणजे हा पक्ष तयार होतो. 

प्रत्येक सरंजामदार हा एक तर तोलामोलाच्या घराण्यातील मोठा माणूस किंवा स्वकर्तुत्वाने मोठा झालेला माणूस. पण या दोन्ही प्रकारच्या माणसांच्या मध्ये एक समान धागा आहे तो म्हणजे BEHIND EVERY FORTUNE THERE IS A CRIME. कोणता ना कोणता झोल करून मोठे झालेली ही मंडळी आहेत. यांच्याकडील संपत्ती ही अलक्ष्मी आहे अर्थात सन्मार्गाने कमावलेली नाही. आणि त्याच मुळे डोक्यावर सतत टांगत्या तलवारी आहेत.. की या संपत्तीचे हरण होऊ शकते, आपल्याला जेल मध्ये जावे लागू शकते.. 

जो मोठा भाई आहे त्याच्याकडे एकच कौशल्य आहे. त्याची manage करण्याची क्षमता अफाट आहे. महाराष्ट्रातील कोणताही पक्ष सत्तेत असो आणि भाई सत्तेत असो वा नसो त्याच्या छत्रछायेत असणाऱ्या प्रत्येक सरंजामदाराला भाई सुरक्षित ठेवतो. त्यासाठी जे काय जुगाडबाजी करायची ती भाई करतो. पण सरंजामदार सुरक्षित रहातो. 

भाई च्या या एकमेव क्षमतेमुळे समस्त सरंजामदार भाईच्या पक्षात / टोळीत होते. स्वतः भाई यांचा बाप म्हणवता येईल असे कांड केलेला आणि पचवलेला प्राणी. त्याला सुद्धा या भीती होत्याच की पण स्वतःची कातडी कशी वाचवायची हे सुद्धा भाईला नेमके माहिती. त्यामुळे केंद्रात कोणाची सत्ता आहे याचा अदमास घेत भाई चाली चालायचा आणि स्वतःला सुरक्षित ठेवायचा. स्वतःच्या बरोबर स्वतःचे बगलबच्चे पण सांभाळायचा. आपल्या वळचणीला असलेल्या मिडिया नामक कुत्र्याचा यथायोग्य वापर करत आपली रॉबिनहूड वाली इमेज कायम जपायचा. 

पण दिल्लीत गुजरातेतील दोन महा गुंड अवतरले आणि त्यांनी भाईचे खच्चीकरण करायला सुरुवात केली. त्यांची वक्र नजर भाईच्या सरंजामदार मंडळींच्या कडे सुद्धा गेली आणि त्यांचे पण लचके तोडले जाऊ लागले. भाई ने साम दाम दंड भेद सगळेच वापरत ९ वर्ष या दोन गुंडांना स्टेल मेट देत देत स्वतःचे आणि स्वतःच्या आश्रित सरंजामदारांचे रक्षण केले. पण याच कालावधीत दोन गुंडांनी भाईचे गल्लीतील स्थान सुद्धा संपुष्टात आणू शकेल असा नवीन भाई राज्यात तयार केला. या तिघांनी मिळून भाईला जेरीला आणले.. हे कमी होते म्हणून प्रकृती अस्वास्थ्य आणि लेकीचे राजकीय करियर उभे करणे आणि सांभाळणे या सगळ्यात भाई गांजून गेला... 

मग सर्वनाशे समुत्पन्ने अर्धं त्यजति पंडितः या न्यायाने त्याने पहिल्यांदा मुलीला पंखाखाली घेतले. तिच्यासाठी अभय मिळवले आणि मग सरंजामदारांना अगदी पुतण्याला सुद्धा सांगितले यापुढे तुमचे रक्षण करणे मला खरच शक्य नाही. मीच त्या गुजराती गुंडांना शरण जाऊन स्थानिक नवीन भाईच्या तावडीतून वाचायचा प्रयत्न करतो आहे. 

सरंजामदार आणि पुतण्याला समजून चुकले.. स्थानिक पातळीवरील नवीन भाई च्या चरणी सेवा रुजू करणे याला पर्याय नाही. त्यानंतर घडलेला घटनाक्रम समोर आहे. 

कुठेही भावनिक होऊ नका... 

Politics is the last resort of scoundrels.

आपल्यावर राज्य करणारा scoundrel हा आपल्या देशाशी एकनिष्ठ असलेला हवा की पाकिस्तान किंवा चीन कडून पैसे घेऊन त्यांच्या सुचनेबरहुकुम काम करणारा असावा फक्त हे ठरवण्याचा अधिकार आपल्याला लोकशाही देते. 

महाराष्ट्रात आणि केंद्रात आपण असा भाई निवडला आहे जो या समस्त भाई मंडळींना टाचेखाली दाबून ठेवेल आणि ते आवश्यक आहे. 

आपण कलियुगात आहोत त्यामुळे आपल्यावर राज्य कल्कीच करणार आहेत. कल्की हा अवतार कसा आहे हे समजून घ्या.. कलियुगात भ्रष्टाचारी असतील तर तो त्यांचा बाप असेल. कलियुगात नीच असतील तर तो त्यांचा बाप असेल. 

ईश्वरी तत्व कसे काम करते ते समजून घ्या... भगवती ज्यावेळी राक्षसांचा संहार करते त्यावेळी ती राक्षस ज्या ज्या गोष्टीत निपुण असतात त्यांच्या पेक्षा अधिक श्रेष्ठत्व सिद्ध करून ती त्यांना संपवते. ते माया युद्ध करतील तर ती महामाया होऊन लढते. ते मल्लयुद्ध करतील तर ती त्यांचे आघात छातीवर घेऊन त्यांना तितक्याच ताकदीने भिरकावून फेकून देते. अस्त्र, शस्त्र, मंत्र , यंत्र , तंत्र प्रत्येक टप्प्यावर ती त्यांच्यापेक्षा श्रेष्ठ होऊन संहार करते आणि म्हणूनच विजयी होते. अन्य देव जिथे पराभूत होतात तिथे ती जिंकते कारण ती नीतीमत्तेचे अवडंबर माजवत नाही. 

हा मुद्दा समजून घ्या... लाल बहादूर शास्त्री हा व्यक्ती चांगलाच होता. त्याला टिकू दिले का ? सत्तेचा खेळ केवळ देशांतर्गत पातळीवर नसतो त्याला आंतरराष्ट्रीय परिमाण सुद्धा असते. अटलबिहारी वाजपेयी त्यांना स्थिर होऊ दिले का ? मनमोहनसिंग सारखा चेहरा ठेवत मागून राज्य कोण चालवत होते ? 

शास्त्री असतील किंवा वाजपेयी ते उत्तम राजकारणपटू होतेच. पण ते नीच नव्हते आणि म्हणून त्यांना बाजूला सारता आले. मोदी नीच आहेत. त्यांच्या पातळीवर जाऊन त्यांच्या प्रत्येक चालीला निष्प्रभ करू शकणारे आहेत म्हणूनच आज टिकले आहेत आणि सर्वश्रेष्ठ आहेत.  

मोदी त्यासाठी श्रेष्ठ आहेत. त्यांना संपवण्याच्या प्रत्येक प्रयत्नांना त्यांनी निष्प्रभ केले आहे आणि ते त्यांच्या छाताडावर बसले आहेत. देवेंद्र फडणवीस हे मिठी छुरी आहेत त्यांनी वरवर भोळेपणाचा चोगा पांघरत या मंडळींना अश्या खिंडीत नेले जिथे त्यांना शरण होण्याशिवाय पर्याय नव्हता. 

त्यामुळे कोन्ग्रेस किती नीच आहे हे आपण गेली ७० वर्षे बोंबलत आहोत.. नेहरूंनी पटेल यांना कसे बाजूला सारले, गांधींनी फाळणी घडवून आणि मुस्लीम तुष्टीकरण करून हिंदूंचे कसे नुकसान केले यावर आपण भरभरून बोलतो. पण त्यावेळी सुद्धा त्यांना निष्प्रभ करायचे असते तर एखाद्या हिंदुत्ववादी नेत्याला नीच व्हावे लागले असते. सावरकर प्रकांड पंडित होते. पण ते नीच होऊ शकले नाहीत आणि म्हणूनच आपल्या डोक्यावर अहिंसेचे भूत गेली ७५ वर्षे नाचत बसले. 

त्यामुळे येणाऱ्या पिढ्यांनी असाच आम्हा हिंदूंना कसे सगळ्यांनी चिरडले हा इतिहास सांगायचा का आम्ही या नीचांवर कशी महानीच होऊन मात केली आणि हिंदू राष्ट्र उभे केले हे अभिमानाने सांगायचे हे आपले मतदान ठरवणार आहे. 

आपला लढा किती विचित्र आहे हे समजून घ्या. या लढ्यातील अस्त्रे समजून घ्या. 

पहिले अस्त्र आहे शाहू फुले आंबेडकर आणि त्या अस्त्राला आपल्याकडे असलेले प्रत्युत्तर आहे हिंदुत्व. 
दुसरे अस्त्र आहे सर्वधर्मसमभाव त्याला उत्तर आहे हिंदू राष्ट्र. 
तिसरे अस्त्र आहे सर्व मार्गांनी मिळवलेला पैसा त्याला उत्तर आहे सुशासन 
चौथे अस्त्र आहे मुस्लीम तुष्टीकरण आणि त्याला उत्तर आहे सबका विकास आणि तुष्टीकरण बंद करणारे सर्वसमावेशक कायदे. 
पाचवे अस्त्र आहे त्यांना वश असलेली सिस्टीम, मिडिया आणि न्याय यंत्रणा याला उत्तर आहे त्यातील जितकी मंडळी शरण आणता येतील तितकी आणणे. त्यासाठी त्या सिस्टीम मधील सगळेच बिभीषण शोधणे आणि त्यांना त्यांच्या मर्यादांसह स्वीकारत त्यांच्या पूर्वायुष्याकडे डोळेझाक करत आज त्यांचा वापर करणे. 

मोदी नेमके हेच करत आहेत. महाराष्ट्रात देवेंद्र फडणवीस सुद्धा तोच प्रयत्न करत आहेत. त्यामुळे २०२४ ची निवडणूक होऊन हिंदू राष्ट्र उद्घोषित होईपर्यंत मोदी आणि देवेंद्र फडणवीस यांचे आंधळे समर्थन करणे आपले कर्तव्य आहे. 

आपल्या संस्कृतीत शरण येणे ही एक संकल्पना आहे तिला समजून घ्या. शरण येणाऱ्या योद्ध्याला शस्त्रहीन केले जाते. त्या नंतर त्याला शस्त्र आपल्या बाजूने लढायला तयार झाला तरच दिले जाते. त्याला प्राणाचे अभय मिळते पण त्याच वेळी पुढे आमच्याच कलाने वागायचे हे बंधन घातले जाते. 

काल भाजपच्या समर्थनार्थ आलेल्या समस्त सरंजामदारांचे शस्त्र काय आहे ? 
अफाट पैसा... 
यांना निशस्त्र कोण करते आहे ? 
ई डी. 
त्यामुळे उरलेली संपत्ती आपल्या कार्यासाठी वापरायचे बंधन घालत बाकीची संपत्ती सरकार जमा झालीच आहे. 
अस्त्र काय आहे ? 
ब्राह्मण द्वेष, हिंदू द्वेष 
आता इकडे आल्यावर जर तेच सुरु राहिले तर त्यांना आणि फडणवीस यांना झोडपून काढायचे त्यात दया माया दाखवण्याची गरज नाही... 

जसे एखाद्या काफिराला मुसलमान केल्यावर तो वजू करताना हात उलटे धुतो का नाही , नमाज पढताना दुवा मागताना चुकून नमस्कार तर करत नाही ना हे जसे बघितले जाते, टोकून योग्य करायला लावले जाते तेच उद्योग आपल्याला मिटकरी आणि भुजबळ यांच्या बाबतीत करावेच लागतील.. आणि ते जुमानत नाही वाटले तर फडणवीस यांना सुद्धा धारेवर धरावेच लागेल.. त्यात सवलत नाही... 

ही सगळी मंडळी शाहू फुले आंबेडकर आणि पुरोगामी महाराष्ट्र या संकल्पनेची फंडिंग फादर होती. पैसे पण द्यायचे आणि मुखातून हेच उद्घोष करायचे. यांचे तोंड आणि पैशाची चंची बंद झाली की आपल्याला हिंदुत्व रुजवणे सोपे होणार आहे. त्यामुळे आता आपण समोरील प्रतिवाद क्षीण होतो आहे हे लक्षात घेऊन सर्वत्र हिंदुत्वाचा झेंडा गाडायला अग्रणी होणे आवश्यक आहे. 

मुस्लीम तुष्टीकरण आणि सर्वधर्मसमभाव वाल्या मंडळीतील काही मुस्लीम इकडे ओढून आणि सर्वसमावेशक योजनांचे त्यांच्या मुखातून कौतुक करून घेऊन आपण मुस्लिमांच्या गठ्ठा मतदानाचे कोन्ग्रेसी स्वप्न उध्वस्त करू शकतो. मुश्रीफ आणि सत्तार यांना त्यासाठी सहन करणे भाग आहे.. त्यांच्या काही उचापतींच्या कडे दुर्लक्ष करणे भाग आहे. 

हिंदू राष्ट्र घोषित होईतो मिडिया, न्यायव्यवस्था आणि प्रशासन हे विरोधातच असणार आहे हे गृहीत धरूनच हा सरंजामदार शरण आणा उद्योग केला गेला आहे. 

आता सामान्य नागरिकांच्या मनातील दोन जळजळीत प्रश्न 

हे इकडे येऊन पण तसेच वागणार नाहीत, आणि घोटाळे करणार नाहीत याची काय हमी ? 
ही जबाबदारी त्यांना आणणाऱ्या मंडळींनी घेतली असणार. तसे होताना दिसले तर आणणाऱ्या मंडळींवर दडपण आणायचे.

अश्या सगळ्या घोटाळेबाजांना घेऊन भाजपाची कोन्ग्रेस होणार नाही याची काय हमी ?
याचे उत्तर दुर्गासप्तशती मध्ये आहे. 

भगवती ज्यावेळी समस्त राक्षसांचा क्रूर संहार करते ती प्रचंड संतप्त झालेली असते. ती रणभूमीवर चालत असते आणि तिच्या पायाखाली जखमी आणि मृत राक्षसांची शरीरे दबत असतात. त्यांच्या अस्थी तुटत असतात आणि ते मरत असतात.. 

याचे काव्यात्मक वर्णन वीर सावरकरांनी "माता दिसली समरी विहरत" म्हणून केले आहे.. 

तर देवीच्या या स्वरूपाला पाहून समस्त जगत भयभीत होते. तिला शांत कसे करणार ? 

त्यावेळी शिव तिच्या मार्गात जाऊन झोपतात. देवी त्यांच्या देहाला पायाखाली चिरडण्याचा प्रयास करते आणि अस्थी भंग पावत नाहीत. ती तत्काळ भानावर येते. कारण केवळ शिव- तिचा पतीच इतका सामर्थ्यवान आहे हे तिला ज्ञात आहे. ती शांत होते. 

मोदी असतील किंवा फडणवीस यांना अप्रमादी ठेवणारे, भानावर आणणारे आणि चुकीचे वर्तन न करू देणारे शिवतत्व म्हणजे राष्ट्रीय स्वयंसेवक संघाचे संस्कार आहेत.. 

त्यामुळे ते अनियंत्रित हुकुमशहा कधीच होणार नाहीत याबद्दल आश्वस्त रहा... 

घडलेल्या घटनाक्रमाला सामान्य माणूस राजकारणाचे सार्वत्रिक अधःपतन म्हणून बघतो आहे. त्याने तसे बघावे हा प्रयत्न मिडिया सुद्धा करतो आहे. कारण यातून अल्पमतदान किंवा नोटा प्रबळ होणे हे घडेल आणि  परंतु एक शक्तीउपासक म्हणून मी हा एक वेगळा दृष्टीकोन देण्याचा प्रयास करतो आहे. 

देवी पण राक्षसांशी नितिमत्तेने लढली असती तर पराभूतच झाली असती. 
कारण महापराक्रमी देव नीतीने लढून हरलेच होते.. 

बिभीषण वश केला नसता तर रावणाचा संहार अशक्य होता. 
रावण आणि त्याचा पुत्र मेघनाद अजेय झालेच होते.. 

कारण नाभीत बाण मारल्याशिवाय अमृतकुंभ नष्ट होणार नाही आणि रावणाचे प्राण जाणार नाहीत हे सांगायला बिभीषण लागतोच. तसेच या समस्त घराणेशाही वाल्या राजकारण्यांचे अमृतकुंभ नष्ट करण्यासाठी त्यांच्यातील बिभीषण हेरणे आणि वश करणे आवश्यक आहे. अर्थात ते त्रेता युग होते आणि हे कलियुग आहे त्यामुळे आजचा बिभीषण सुद्धा भ्रष्ट असणारच हा युगाचा महिमा आहे हे लक्षात घ्या. 

त्यामुळे कालची राजकीय घडामोड ही बरीचशी ३७० रद्द करण्यापूर्वी मेहबूबा मुफ्तीशी केलेल्या युतीसामान आहे हे भाजपा समर्थकांनी आणि मतदारांनी समजून घ्यावे मोदी शहा आणि देवेंद्र फडणवीस यांच्या हेतूंबद्दल शंका बाळगू नये हे अत्यंत महत्वाचे आहे. 

आपल्या नेत्यांचे आणि आपले ध्येय समान आहे. हिंदू राष्ट्र , सनातन संस्कृतीचे पुनरुत्थान व समृद्ध , संपन्न असा विश्व गुरु भारत त्या मार्गावर असलेल्या नेत्यांचे हात बळकट करणे आपले कर्तव्य आहे. 

शेवटी अटलजींच्याच शब्दात सांगायचे असेल तर सध्या मिळालेली सत्ता हा एक पडाव आहे, टप्पा आहे. आपले ध्येय फार मोठे आहे आणि ते गाठताना काही वेळा तडजोडी कराव्या लागतील आपण त्या परिपक्व होऊन मान्य केल्या पाहिजेत... 

अटलजी म्हणतात.. 

हम पड़ाव को समझे मंजिल लक्ष्य हुआ आखों से ओझल 
वर्तमान के मोहपाश में आनेवाला कल न भुलाए 
आओ एक दिया जलाए.

[7/13/23, 7:59:31 AM] Neelesh: We can dream of apple in india where we innovate to produce chips n software
[7/13/23, 8:00:23 AM] Neelesh: Hopefully it happens in my lifetime , till then I will buzz to u to get me mac , iPhone from usa every 5 years
[7/13/23, 8:03:00 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Even Apple doesn't manufacture its own chips. It outsources from TSMC in Taiwan. So you do not have to manufacture chips in India to innovate
[7/13/23, 8:03:24 AM] Rahul Modi: ‎This message was deleted.
[7/13/23, 8:04:07 AM] Rahul Modi: Lol.. who told you this
[7/13/23, 8:04:32 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: It's a good dream to have sure.. but remember that not every developed country manufactures its own chops
[7/13/23, 8:05:13 AM] Neelesh: Aree if u don’t rely on import
[7/13/23, 8:05:22 AM] Neelesh: But obvious u can control price

[7/13/23, 8:05:50 AM] Rahul Modi: Apple outsource karta hain to other foundries .. iPhone ka price doesn’t depend on that
[7/13/23, 8:05:55 AM] Neelesh: Thts why usa started its fabrication
[7/13/23, 8:06:20 AM] Rahul Modi: This was not ur point initially.. you wanted electronics to be cheap
[7/13/23, 8:06:45 AM] Rahul Modi: Being independent yes that should be priority
[7/13/23, 8:07:35 AM] Neelesh: Don’t compare usa ka currency to ruppes
[7/13/23, 8:07:46 AM] Neelesh: For them india n China is cheap option
[7/13/23, 8:07:51 AM] Neelesh: Not for us
[7/13/23, 8:07:52 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: When you are an innovation player, you price based on value to customer and ur brand reputation. You do not price based on manufacturing cost
[7/13/23, 8:08:11 AM] Neelesh: N we don’t want to depend on China or Taiwan
[7/13/23, 8:08:13 AM] Rahul Modi: USA dint start fabrication ?.. intel already tha idhar .. they just got tsmc which overtook intel for latest process nodes
[7/13/23, 8:08:17 AM] Neelesh: N we can import from USA

[7/13/23, 8:09:13 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Please stop dreaming and live in reality
[7/13/23, 8:10:07 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: And then u will criticize India for not meeting your dreams
[7/13/23, 8:11:46 AM] Neelesh: I am not saying this ..this is vision of PM
[7/13/23, 8:12:57 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: This is long term vision.. Rome wasn't built in a day
[7/13/23, 8:13:44 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: There is no guarantee of success. Already we are aware of the roadblocks
[7/13/23, 8:13:50 AM] Neelesh: @14254181586  u realize na this post is not mine

[10/5/23, 11:23:57 AM] Milind: Shikhar Dhawan was married to Aesha Mukerji, who had two daughters from her previous marriage. Shikhar and Aesha had a son together. Yesterday, court granted him divorce on the grounds of cruelty by his wife.

The court observed :

1. The wife had agreed to live with him in India at the time of marriage but refused later due to her commitment to her ex-husband and their two daughters in Australia. She took their son with her, forcing Dhawan to live alone in India.

2. She demanded and acquired ownership of 99% of Dhawan's three Australian properties, along with joint ownership of two others, all of which he had purchased with his money.

3. She purposely sent defamatory messages about Dhawan to various authorities in BCCI, owners of the IPL team, and his fellow cricketers to pressure and humiliate Dhawan, ensuring she received her monthly maintenance on time.

4. The Court also acknowledged Aesha's dispute with Dhawan for taking his ailing father to the hospital during his COVID-19 infection.

5. In 2020, Aesha and their son came to India for an extended stay, while her daughters remained in Australia. She compelled Dhawan to send AU $15,500 monthly to her daughters from her previous marriage.

Sad what this man had to go through.

[10/24/23, 1:12:25 PM] Tambe: Simon Doull during Commentary : " Last time when I compared Babar with Scott Edwards, some Pakistanis trolled me. I will repeat myself, Pakistan has the worst Spinners, worst captain, worst fielding side and worst pace attack. You cannot win a match when your captain scores 74 (92) and gets out after paying 41 overs. This clearly shows he played for his records and not for the team"

This number is, evidently, a significant undercount of the total number of project-affected trees.

[1/2/24, 2:05:40 PM] Pritam Khomne: Accenture ke prb solve kar pehle
[1/2/24, 2:30:14 PM] Milind: Section 104(2) of the proposed law says, "Whoever causes death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide and escapes from the scene of incident or fails to report the incident to a Police officer or Magistrate soon after the incident, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description of a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."

The government has also proposed a significantly longer jail term for death due to rash and negligent driving not amounting to culpable homicide. Section 104(1) of the Sanhita proposes a jail term of up to seven years as opposed to two years under Section 304A of the IPC. Both sections also provide for fines being slapped on the offenders.

Spotify kaa hai yeh Raja , apni aawaaz se daale subscribers pe ye jaal

Garhwal ho yaa Gavanpada , pataa le yeh koi bhi chhinaal

Jiske din ho pachaas hazaar , Utne jiyo tum saal

Love you Bhai , Happy Birthday Captain Parneet Darbaan ‎<This message was edited>

[2/24/24, 9:26:52 AM] Amod Tilak: Isse aur ummeed bhi nahi. 
North Korea ko democracy bol Diya. Uske aage kya dekhe?
Pick and choose incidences. Same thing happened with Gandhis. Still happens.
[2/24/24, 9:27:34 AM] Pritam Khomne: Dhruv sethi ka fav hai
[2/24/24, 9:27:51 AM] Amod Tilak: Obviously rahega
[2/24/24, 9:29:03 AM] Amod Tilak: Jaise dhruv se koi aur ummeed nahi, pick and choose kar ke dikhayega.
Waise Sethi se bhi kuch ummeed nahi, aise chutiyon ko hi follow karega
[2/24/24, 9:29:53 AM] Amod Tilak: Simple thing if AAP ke do leader par galat case thoka hai, to why have they not got bail still? And why is khujliwal afraid of going to the court if he is sure he won't be caught?
[2/24/24, 9:36:17 AM] Amod Tilak: The Emergency (India) - Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)

[2/24/24, 9:38:07 AM] Amod Tilak: You need to understand Pritam, everything that's happening started after minorities ki sachhai baahar aane lagi. Vote bank politics ke naam pe in chutiyon ke voters who are predominantly people of one colour and also infiltrators are being called out
[2/24/24, 9:38:14 AM] Amod Tilak: Ye sab hua to lag gaye lavde

[2/24/24, 9:40:11 AM] Amod Tilak: In a way ab public in chutiye farmers ko bhi support nahi kar raha.
[2/24/24, 9:41:03 AM] Amod Tilak: Propoganda karein congress apne laande terrorists ko bachane ke liye, to aise jhaatee mangte na bhakchod videos banane ke liye
[2/24/24, 10:36:36 AM] Praneet Dabral: Long topic hai yaar ye. Face to face hi discussion ho sakta hai

[3/1/24, 10:38:02 AM] Pritam Khomne: He did nt play ipd before World Cup got fit instead 
Scored centuries in World Cup 
Pandya Kya ukhada injury ke saath ipl khela 
Suddenly 1 match nahi khelna not even warning out of contract
[3/1/24, 10:43:05 AM] Nitish: Becoz Pandya is not considered or not good enough to play test cricket.
[3/1/24, 10:43:56 AM] Nitish: Shreyas Iyer se expectation tha, but...
[3/1/24, 10:44:17 AM] Pritam Khomne: I sense sarcasm here
[3/1/24, 10:45:37 AM] Milind: Apparently Pandya has said he'll play for domestic when there are no international committments.
[3/1/24, 10:45:46 AM] Amod Tilak: Bhai the injuries are managed at the national institute. He wasn't injured, wasn't available for India and also made himself unavailable for the ranji quarter final
[3/1/24, 10:45:51 AM] Milind: the selectors and the BCCI only handed Hardik a contract after the all-rounder gave an undertaking that if there are no white-ball commitments with the national team, he would feature for Baroda in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s and Vijay Hazare Trophy.
[3/1/24, 10:46:05 AM] Milind: According to the Future Tours Programme, India are scheduled to play only three T20Is at home against Bangladesh as the team has a busy Test calendar. In the October-December period, when India don’t have any white-ball commitments, the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s and Vijay Hazare Trophy would be conducted. And unless Pandya has any fitness issues, he has been directed to feature in both these tournaments.
[3/1/24, 10:46:30 AM] Milind: Direct Oct Dec chi commitment dili ahe bhau ne
Let's c if he actually plays
[3/1/24, 10:46:39 AM] Nitish: These are T20 tournaments
[3/1/24, 10:47:10 AM] Milind: Tech tar 
Selective decisions ahet
[3/1/24, 10:47:14 AM] Amod Tilak: And if he plays ranji semis, plays the next season of ranji trophy, he will be reinstated on the contracts.
[3/1/24, 10:47:37 AM] Pritam Khomne: This is selective picking and politics
[3/1/24, 10:47:49 AM] Amod Tilak: Rishabh pant is still on the contracts because he played some of the domestic circuits.
[3/1/24, 10:48:21 AM] Amod Tilak: Just a game or so. But he has made himself open for everything the domestic circuits offer. So he is in contracts.
[3/1/24, 10:48:53 AM] Nitish: Naa. If he is considered for only white ball cricket then he is expected to play white ball domestic tournament. So don't see any selective issue here
[3/1/24, 10:48:56 AM] Pritam Khomne: Y can’t u accept bccci overreacted 
N stay rationale once
[3/1/24, 10:49:04 AM] Amod Tilak: U mean dictatorship?
[3/1/24, 10:49:06 AM] Milind: Communication issue pan ahe
Iyer was declared fit but he was not feeling comfortable

Same for KL Rahul
[3/1/24, 10:49:09 AM] Milind: Rahul complained of discomfort in his right quadriceps immediately after the first Test which India lost. The initial prognosis done by BCCI medical staff at National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru, where Rahul went for rehab, suggested he would be fit in time for the third Test, which was played in Rajkot between February 15 to 18. The selectors had named Rahul in the squad for the final three Tests subject to fitness.

However, Rahul never travelled to Rajkot, informing the medical staff he was not feeling 100% confident about his quad. He then missed the Vizag and Ranchi Tests too, as he continued to feel stiffness in his right leg despite the scans conducted at NCA not showing any red flags. Rahul is understood to have spoken to the selectors to update them about the same. Once the specialist in London provides a report, Rahul needs to get a clearance from NCA before resuming cricket.
[3/1/24, 10:49:39 AM] Milind: So he won't be playing tests in future ka
[3/1/24, 10:49:50 AM] Nitish: Aukad nahi aahe
[3/1/24, 10:49:52 AM] Pritam Khomne: Iyer must have been with dhanashri 
Personal comminents bhi hai na
[3/1/24, 10:49:57 AM] Amod Tilak: I am rationale. You don't feel so is a different issue.
[3/1/24, 10:50:37 AM] Pritam Khomne: Madarchod Pandya ko aane de mumbai gand marenge ipl main
[3/1/24, 10:50:42 AM] Milind: Injured on day 3
[3/1/24, 10:50:54 AM] Pritam Khomne: Already gujrat wale bhadke hai
[3/1/24, 10:50:58 AM] Amod Tilak: Exactly. He was declared fit, he was asked to play domestic. He made himself unavailable.
[3/1/24, 10:51:22 AM] Nitish: Yes and no skill set, no temperament to play 5 days.
[3/1/24, 10:51:57 AM] Pritam Khomne: Ye time tho chalenge yaar

[4/11/24, 10:31:01 PM] Amod Tilak: Rinku Singh - superb basis ipl.
Guhal - excellent bowler.
Yadav best bowler basis ipl.
Dhavan best opener basis ipl. 
But can't take krunal, markande, madhwal, basis ipl coz they play for mumbai.  
Captaincy can't be based on IPL. So we give captaincy for six years to Kohli. 
But guhal pant yadav and Rinku Singh ka selection hona chaiye basis ipl
[4/11/24, 10:31:11 PM] Amod Tilak: Fucking dogle insaan
[4/11/24, 10:33:25 PM] Amod Tilak: Forgot the biggest of them all. 

Rohit is a flat track bully. 
But Virat has the highest runs in ipl coz he is a technical batsman. Lavde ka technical batsman. Fucking flat track bully. But no he is the greatest batsman of all time.
[4/11/24, 10:33:46 PM] Pritam Khomne: Virat is goat

[4/11/24, 10:52:46 PM] Amod Tilak: Doglapan.
[4/11/24, 10:52:50 PM] Pritam Khomne: Rohit ?
[4/11/24, 10:53:28 PM] Amod Tilak: Virat has the highest runs in ipl. So bigger flat track bully Virat hua na? Itna bhi nahi samajhta??
[4/11/24, 10:53:42 PM] Amod Tilak: Ghutne me hai ya gotiyon me?
[4/11/24, 10:54:11 PM] Amod Tilak: That too no titles. Only runs scored
[4/11/24, 10:54:46 PM] Amod Tilak: So I must say selfish flat track bully ek hi hai. Virat.

[4/11/24, 10:58:24 PM] Pritam Khomne: Hahahab Ruma nahi banaya tho selfless
[4/11/24, 10:58:59 PM] Pritam Khomne: Hitman -the flat track lord

[4/20/24, 10:13:49 PM] Sriram Govindarajan: @13135550002 who is the best wicket keeper for Indian cricket team for T20 format right now?
[4/20/24, 10:13:55 PM] Meta AI: Here are the best wicket-keepers for the Indian cricket team for the T20 format ¹ ²:
- *Rishabh Pant*: He is the top favorite to make it to the Indian squad given his fitness and good form in some of the big games he has played since his return.
- *Sanju Samson*: He has been a revelation in IPL 2024 both with batting and his captaincy, taking Rajasthan Royals to the top of the points table with six wins out of seven games.
- *Ishan Kishan*: He has been in impressive form and the next on the contenders list. Both players have been consistently contributing runs for their respective teams this season.
- *KL Rahul*: He has showcased his class with a batting average that matches Kishan's at 34. But his lower strike rate of 138.8 has raised questions about his ability to accelerate the innings.
- *Dinesh Karthik*: His recent efforts have prompted many experts to say that he deserves to be a part of the World Cup team discussions as well! His 35 ball 83 chasing 288 against Sunrisers Hyderabad made his social media fans root for his inclusion in the World Cup team. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/21/24, 3:55:47 AM] Tambe: @13135550002 My friend Sriram is of Indian origin but living in US for 16 years now, what is the probability that he will ever return
[4/21/24, 3:55:49 AM] Meta AI: It's difficult to predict the future, and the probability of Sriram returning to India depends on various factors, including personal, professional, and emotional considerations. However, I can provide some insights based on common trends and factors that influence the decisions of Indian expats in the US.

After 16 years in the US, Sriram has likely established a strong foundation in his career, built a social network, and developed a sense of belonging. Factors that might influence his decision to return to India include:

1. *Family ties*: If Sriram has family in India, especially aging parents or close relatives, he might consider returning to be closer to them.
2. *Career opportunities*: If Sriram has a strong career in the US, he might be hesitant to leave behind his professional network and opportunities. However, if he finds equivalent or better opportunities in India, he might consider returning.
3. *Cultural and social connections*: Sriram might miss Indian culture, food, and social connections, which could draw him back to India.
4. *Personal reasons*: Health, relationships, or a sense of belonging might also influence his decision.
5. *Indian economy and growth*: India's growing economy and opportunities might attract Sriram to return and contribute to his home country.
6. *Visa and immigration status*: If Sriram has obtained US citizenship or a green card, he might have more flexibility to move between countries.

Given these factors, it's difficult to estimate a probability of Sriram returning to India. However, here's a rough breakdown:

- *20-30%*: Sriram might return to India if he has strong family ties, career opportunities, or personal reasons.
- *40-50%*: He might stay in the US if he has established a strong career, social network, and a sense of belonging.
- *30-40%*: He might consider moving back and forth between the US and India, depending on his circumstances and priorities.

Keep in mind that these are rough estimates and might not apply to Sriram's specific situation. Ultimately, the decision to return to India depends on his individual priorities, circumstances, and goals. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/21/24, 10:20:33 PM] Meta AI: I cannot find any information that suggests Manchester United will start a new era today. However, here are some recent news about Manchester United ¹:
- Former Premier League midfielder Cesc Fabregas has spoken about Manchester United's poor form.
- Erik ten Hag deserves credit if he can lead Manchester United to a third final in his first two seasons.
- There is now a 1.1% chance that a fifth-qualifying place materializes in the Champions League.
- Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger says the club should take inspiration from rivals Liverpool for their recruitment strategy. ‎<This message was edited>

- *Managerial uncertainty*: Antonio Conte's contract expires at the end of the season, and there is speculation about his future at the club.
- *Player injuries*: The team is dealing with injuries to key players like Hugo Lloris, Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, and Ryan Sessegnon. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/30/24, 9:33:49 PM] Amod Tilak: Agarkar lost his balls in his wedding to a terrorist. What happened to the others who picked the BIGEST LOSER IN KOHLI as captain for six years. No balls or no balls and vocal cords???

[6/5/24, 12:53:12 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes, because Hindi does not equal Hinduism. U cannot force ppl from north to talk in Tamil either

[6/5/24, 12:53:56 AM] Pritam Khomne: Not telling as means of enjoyment but means of communication 
English is accepted y not Hindi ?
[6/5/24, 12:54:39 AM] Pritam Khomne: Do they want you to stay there in tht state for whole life ? 
Wil not communicate with other states ?
[6/5/24, 12:56:21 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: South Indian politics is different, very fragmented.. difficult for BJP to gain ground there so easily. Especially with the perception that they will force Hindi/north culture

[6/5/24, 6:26:28 AM] Milind: In Maharashtra, the BJP’s tally came down to 9 from 23, and in Rajasthan 14 from 25. It had won all the 25 seats in Rajasthan in 2014 and 2019 and returned to power in the state just a few months ago.

In Karnataka, where the BJP had 25 of the 28 seats, its tally came down to 17. In Haryana, the BJP lost 5 of the 10 seats it won. In West Bengal, where the party was hoping to make major gains, it could win only 12, down from 18 in 2019. In Bihar too, the BJP suffered reverses as its tally came down from 17 to 12.
[6/5/24, 6:28:11 AM] Milind: 👆🏻 Almost 50 seats lost

[6/18/24, 1:07:55 AM] Pritam Khomne: Dhruv rathee ka bhai
[6/18/24, 1:08:07 AM] Rahul Modi: Should we trust some random insta post
[6/18/24, 1:08:40 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: U can check facts.. about MPs, Supreme court judges, etc.. what is there to trust a post
[6/18/24, 1:09:21 AM] Rahul Modi: What about the increase of landya population
[6/18/24, 1:09:26 AM] Rahul Modi: Can you share that as well
[6/18/24, 1:11:39 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Between 1951 and 2011, the Muslim population rose from 35.4 million to 172 million. The Hindu population rose from 303 million to 966 million in the same period – a five times greater increase
[6/18/24, 1:12:05 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: In reality, however, Muslim fertility rates are falling the fastest among all major religious groups in India, according to the government’s own data. The fertility rate – the average number of children a woman gives birth to – among Muslims fell from 4.41 to 2.36 between 1992 and 2021, while it dropped from 3.3 to 1.94 for Hindus.
[6/18/24, 1:12:37 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Please don't trust Whatsapp university @917506094210 @12132803490 🙏🙏

[6/18/24, 1:13:22 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: This directly addresses your concern on landya population increase
[6/18/24, 1:13:38 AM] Pritam Khomne: Bhai in general fertility of this generation is leas
[6/18/24, 1:13:43 AM] Pritam Khomne: Hindus is more less
[6/18/24, 1:13:50 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Implement UCC and it will come down further

[6/18/24, 1:14:12 AM] Pritam Khomne: Plz share if u have read
[6/18/24, 1:14:37 AM] Pritam Khomne: Becoz I have not heard not read even if it is published
[6/18/24, 1:14:56 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Largest Muslim population in world doesn't mean anything. It's not the largest proportion of the population, that will still be Hindu. And it is indigenous Muslims, not immigrants like you see in Europe
[6/18/24, 1:15:11 AM] Rahul Modi: Lol.. taking data from last 60 yrs.. obv will be skewed
[6/18/24, 1:15:36 AM] Pritam Khomne: Yes these is prediction and as per ur fertility post it can’t be achieved
[6/18/24, 1:15:47 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Past data dekhna is skewed?? Past is best indicator of future for context
[6/18/24, 1:15:53 AM] Pritam Khomne: So it will be not be known and only realized with time
[6/18/24, 1:16:10 AM] Rahul Modi: Nope.. that’s the difference … landya still having 3-4 children
[6/18/24, 1:16:13 AM] Pritam Khomne: So realization is 
Sarfaraz dhoka dega
[6/18/24, 1:16:26 AM] Rahul Modi: Not true
[6/18/24, 1:17:11 AM] Pritam Khomne: Problem is they vote in synchrony
[6/18/24, 1:17:18 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: I don't know about that.. the fact is India will not be islamized in our lifetimes. So stop worrying about it
[6/18/24, 1:17:19 AM] Pritam Khomne: That happened during this time
[6/18/24, 1:17:36 AM] Pritam Khomne: They Dnt vote for development they dnt look for tht
[6/18/24, 1:17:37 AM] Rahul Modi: Have to take steps now to prevent that in future
[6/18/24, 1:17:41 AM] Pritam Khomne: They look for religion
[6/18/24, 1:17:54 AM] Pritam Khomne: For them good and bad is thy
[6/18/24, 1:18:14 AM] Pritam Khomne: Hindu voted and will always vote for goodness and rightness
[6/18/24, 1:18:20 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: How does it matter.. Muslim population growth rate being higher is not going to matter in the actual demography for at least next 50 years or so
[6/18/24, 1:18:22 AM] Pritam Khomne: And this y it’s dangerous
[6/18/24, 1:18:59 AM] Rahul Modi: It will matter during voting ..
[6/18/24, 1:19:25 AM] Pritam Khomne: U only saw rampur voting
[6/18/24, 1:19:27 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes, so implement law to prevent multiple wives for a Muslim man
[6/18/24, 1:20:21 AM] Rahul Modi: Bc.. sab democrats will start crying why this injustice n all
[6/18/24, 1:20:26 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Of course it will.. if you practice the policy of us vs them
[6/18/24, 1:20:44 AM] Rahul Modi: Which policy of us vs them
[6/18/24, 1:20:49 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Why would you care for development if your life could be on the line
[6/18/24, 1:20:59 AM] Rahul Modi: No one is killing them
[6/18/24, 1:21:09 AM] Rahul Modi: What life on line
[6/18/24, 1:22:01 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Modi talking against Muslims during elections.. why would they vote for his party
[6/18/24, 1:22:11 AM] Rahul Modi: What did he say?
[6/18/24, 1:22:21 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: It's the same as.. why would you vote for owaisi if you lived in his constituency
[6/18/24, 1:22:38 AM] Pritam Khomne: Becoz he will do same post election also
[6/18/24, 1:22:41 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Check Kar news

[6/18/24, 1:23:15 AM] Rahul Modi: If you check dhruv rathi news then okay 👍
[6/18/24, 1:23:18 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Exactly.. so how do u expect them to vote for BJP.. they will obviously make their vote count by voting uniformly
[6/18/24, 1:23:34 AM] Pritam Khomne: Nothing else he later did appeasement also
[6/18/24, 1:23:37 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Ghuspeti n all.. clear reference to muslims
[6/18/24, 1:23:57 AM] Rahul Modi: Ghuspeti from Bangladesh

[6/18/24, 1:24:44 AM] Pritam Khomne: Google n check pictures
[6/18/24, 1:24:45 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: If u were in owaisi constituency, would you and other Hindus not vote for his opponent to ensure he is defeated?
[6/18/24, 1:25:11 AM] Pritam Khomne: Ayodya they posted for sp
[6/18/24, 1:25:21 AM] Pritam Khomne: He lost bastian
[6/18/24, 1:25:32 AM] Pritam Khomne: Forget me
[6/18/24, 1:26:00 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: They voted for SP coz of yadav caste influence
[6/18/24, 1:26:37 AM] Pritam Khomne: What was ayodhya name earlier ? 
How much population is Muslim ?
[6/18/24, 1:28:24 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: What I am saying is.. if you have a mentality of us vs them, then they have the same mentality as well. So will vote for any party that is against them
[6/18/24, 1:29:13 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: This is not a India exclusive thing. Happens everywhere in the world. Minorities do not generally vote for right wing nationalist parties
[6/18/24, 1:29:30 AM] Pritam Khomne: Tht is what we are telling 
We need have tht mentality 
It is not there 
It is there from other side only 
So these memes and quotes to awaken
[6/18/24, 1:29:43 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Even in US, first generation Indians hardly vote for Republicans..

[6/18/24, 1:31:04 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: So u r saying u want a Hindu religious state.. and not a secular state..
[6/18/24, 1:31:07 AM] Pritam Khomne: Half Dnt vote 
Half vote for righteousness 
Half money
[6/18/24, 1:31:45 AM] Pritam Khomne: Hindu state is a secular state 

U only said once if u remember 

I am Hindu so I am secular
[6/18/24, 1:32:24 AM] Pritam Khomne: Which party is Pakistan is telling to beware of Hindus ?
[6/18/24, 1:32:46 AM] Pritam Khomne: How much population of Hindus is grown in Pakistan ?
[6/18/24, 1:32:49 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Because not everyone is driven by Muslim hate.. and Muslim danger
[6/18/24, 1:32:52 AM] Pritam Khomne: Y in India so ?
[6/18/24, 1:33:16 AM] Pritam Khomne: It will not be realized 

Reason we Wer always ruled by others
[6/18/24, 1:33:18 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Don't compare India to Pakistan. That is a terrorist state
[6/18/24, 1:33:33 AM] Pritam Khomne: Mughals 
Britishers
[6/18/24, 1:33:35 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: They will oppress minorities
[6/18/24, 1:33:47 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: do u want India to do the same?
[6/18/24, 1:33:54 AM] Pritam Khomne: Y not 
If there population explosion is a prb
[6/18/24, 1:34:31 AM] Pritam Khomne: Do u want India to turn in to Pakistan?
[6/18/24, 1:34:49 AM] Pritam Khomne: Just read abt Belgium today when u get time
[6/18/24, 1:34:56 AM] Pritam Khomne: What is happening there
[6/18/24, 1:35:12 AM] Pritam Khomne: Chal gn sd
[6/18/24, 1:35:40 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: No, that's why I am saying . Don't do "us vs them" politics coz Pakistan has done it long back

[6/18/24, 1:46:02 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: @12132803490 you too
[6/18/24, 1:48:05 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: And if doubts r still there, I would recommend a good course on statistics to take
[6/18/24, 2:02:13 AM] Rahul Modi: Aljazheera news 😂
okay sriram 🙏
[6/18/24, 2:13:00 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Look at numbers and their source, not who is reporter 🙏
[6/18/24, 3:11:41 AM] Rahul Modi: Interesting way to interpret the data… the percentage increase of Muslim population is 385% compared to 218% for Hindus but author choose to ignore this data
[6/18/24, 3:15:48 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes because that is inconsequential in the large scheme
[6/18/24, 3:19:34 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: In absolute numbers, the difference or the gap is not closing anytime soon
[6/18/24, 3:20:12 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: In fact, it is still increasing as of today
[6/18/24, 3:20:33 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: So stop worrying about these things 🙏
[6/18/24, 3:22:23 AM] Rahul Modi: How?
[6/18/24, 3:23:07 AM] Rahul Modi: The data in the paper shows the percentage of M population is increasing
[6/18/24, 3:23:17 AM] Rahul Modi: Gap kaise badega ‎<This message was edited>
[6/18/24, 3:23:29 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: U r confusing percentages with numbers
[6/18/24, 3:23:34 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Let me explain
[6/18/24, 3:24:00 AM] Rahul Modi: You have think of percentage not the absolute numbers
[6/18/24, 3:26:28 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: If M increases from 100 to 115, it's a 15% increase in their population.
If H increases from 1000 to 1100, it's a 10% increase in their population.

But in terms of numbers, the H-M gap has increased from 900 (1000 - 100) to 985 (1100 - 115) ‎<This message was edited>
[6/18/24, 3:30:28 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Hope it makes sense. Percentages r secondary to actual numbers in overall strength of the population
[6/18/24, 3:35:01 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Technically, u should have more Hindus eligible for voting than Muslims in India after every 5 year period. So this notion peddled by Whatsapp university is really baseless
[6/18/24, 3:45:14 AM] Rahul Modi: Arre lekin M ka percentage toh increase hua na .. initially they were 10% of the total population and now they are 15 % of the total
[6/18/24, 3:45:52 AM] Rahul Modi: M ka pura 15% will also go for anti-bjp irrespective of anything
[6/18/24, 3:47:04 AM] Rahul Modi: H ka waisa nahi hain.. it is first of all declining and upar se aadha vote doesn’t go to bjp
[6/18/24, 3:49:11 AM] Rahul Modi: Ye toh honewala hi hain.. number wise H ka population will always be more but all their votes don’t go to one party unlike M
[6/18/24, 4:07:22 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: That's not the issue though.. the issue was 'hindus khatre mein hai' which is not true if you look at the overall population numbers and trend ‎<This message was edited>
[6/18/24, 4:11:31 AM] Rahul Modi: The trend shows M percentage increased from 10 to 14% and H decreased from 84 to 78%
[6/18/24, 4:11:45 AM] Rahul Modi: It will increase from 14 to 20 in the next 20-30 yrs
[6/18/24, 4:12:45 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes. Increase in 5% over a period of 60 years. We probably won't be alive till they make it to even 20%
[6/18/24, 4:13:14 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes, over 50+ years
[6/18/24, 4:13:29 AM] Rahul Modi: If it reaches 20% then it’s over
[6/18/24, 4:13:31 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: How?? I just explained that it cannot happen
[6/18/24, 4:14:43 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: The more the population of M, the slower will be the percentage rise.. that's basic maths
[6/18/24, 4:15:30 AM] Rahul Modi: Why can’t it happen.. slow hoga but it is possible
[6/18/24, 4:16:15 AM] Rahul Modi: H don’t produce 3-4 bacha now.. that trend has stopped now.; it was ther till 80s
[6/18/24, 4:16:31 AM] Rahul Modi: But M ka waisa nahi hain.. they still do 3-4 even now
[6/18/24, 4:17:12 AM] Rahul Modi: The percentage change between 1950s to 80s will be different than between 90s to now
[6/18/24, 4:18:42 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes, possible in 60 years or so.. assuming all other factors remain the same.. like fertility rates, govt policies, religiousness of the population, etc. But looking at trends, they will only change that will further slow down their population growth
[6/18/24, 4:21:36 AM] Rahul Modi: M ka entire life revolves around religion !
[6/18/24, 4:22:53 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: U r talking as if there are almost equal number of H and M families. Then what you are saying make sense. But H families are 5 times more than M families. So if 5x2 bacchas are still way higher than 1x3 or 1x4
[6/18/24, 4:23:41 AM] Rahul Modi: Ganta anyone does 2 now.. that’s also rare
[6/18/24, 4:24:26 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes, so u change policies is what I told.. get more M kids in schools rather than madrassas.. ban polygamy
[6/18/24, 4:25:53 AM] Rahul Modi: If you change polices for 1 religion alljazeera will again print article on minority harassment
[6/18/24, 4:27:37 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Look at this data then..
For H, 1.94 x 5 = 9.7
For M, 2.36 x 1 = 2.36
If you want to take 3, H is producing 3 times as many kids as M
[6/18/24, 4:29:06 AM] Rahul Modi: This might be for 1 M marriage 😀
[6/18/24, 4:29:16 AM] Rahul Modi: They do multiple marriages
[6/18/24, 4:30:04 AM] Rahul Modi: Let’s say 2 so the numbers are now half
[6/18/24, 4:30:15 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yeah, who is asking their approval anyway
[6/18/24, 4:30:43 AM] Rahul Modi: There haven’t been any policy so far which are against them
[6/18/24, 4:31:09 AM] Rahul Modi: But if they want special treatment Gand marao
[6/18/24, 4:33:27 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Even if we consider all the M ppl have 2 wives, the number will be 2.36 x 2 = 4.72

This is still less than half of 9.7
[6/18/24, 4:34:31 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: So for every 1 M kid born, there will be more than 2 H kids born as of today
[6/18/24, 4:37:24 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: For sure, multiple  marriages will be banned in the next few decades. And fertility rates will further fall (even though they may be higher than fertility rate for H)
[6/18/24, 4:37:54 AM] Rahul Modi: Never gonna get banned in india for sure
[6/18/24, 4:40:16 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: If not, it will be rare
[6/18/24, 4:40:43 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Polygamy has entered the political discourse in the past few months owing to speculation over a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), but data shows the practice is rare in India — so much so that only 1.4 per cent of married Indian women surveyed in 2019-2021 said their husbands had another wife or wives.
[6/18/24, 4:40:47 AM] Rahul Modi: Wishful thinking
[6/18/24, 4:41:28 AM] Rahul Modi: Married M* women ‎<This message was edited>
[6/18/24, 4:41:40 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: https://theprint.in/india/its-not-just-muslims-who-have-multiple-wives-in-india-but-practice-has-declined-across-faiths/1578799/?amp
[6/18/24, 4:43:29 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: The National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-20) showed the prevalence of polygamy was 2.1% among Christians, 1.9% among Muslims, 1.3% among Hindus, and 1.6% among other religious groups.
The data showed that the highest prevalence of polygynous marriages was in the Northeastern states with tribal populations.
A list of 40 districts with the highest polygyny rates was dominated by those with high tribal populations.
[6/18/24, 4:44:02 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Another theory debunked
[6/18/24, 4:45:28 AM] Rahul Modi: How many of these marriages actually get registered
[6/18/24, 4:49:57 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Don't know.. but lot of good reasons for getting marriages registered
[6/18/24, 4:51:43 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Alimony, insurance, pension, kids custody, travel, etc
[6/18/24, 4:53:43 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Haj travel to be more specific 😀
[6/18/24, 4:54:35 AM] Rahul Modi: Alimony ka concept nahi hota in logo mein 😂
[6/18/24, 4:54:44 AM] Rahul Modi: Insurance .. lol
[6/18/24, 4:54:50 AM] Rahul Modi: Pension ganta
[6/18/24, 5:09:39 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: If you believe 1.9% to be low, make it more than double. Still only 4-5% max polygamy in M
[6/18/24, 5:10:11 AM] Rahul Modi: Based on only 2 years data
[6/18/24, 5:10:17 AM] Rahul Modi: Low SS
[6/18/24, 5:11:04 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Latest data hi toh dekhega.. u r looking at latest numbers, not growth trends over many years
[6/18/24, 5:11:31 AM] Rahul Modi: What is the sample size
‎[6/18/24, 5:12:32 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: ‎image omitted
‎[6/18/24, 5:13:10 AM] Rahul Modi: ‎image omitted
[6/18/24, 5:13:42 AM] Rahul Modi: Looks like it was survey not actual data
[6/18/24, 5:14:38 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yeah, survey is one source of collecting data.. may not be the most accurate, but it is a good indicator
[6/18/24, 5:15:10 AM] Rahul Modi: Nope.. look at the election poll survey data and actual results
[6/18/24, 5:15:22 AM] Rahul Modi: Not always correct
[6/18/24, 5:15:22 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes, that makes it ~2% of overall women
[6/18/24, 5:16:18 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: The point is to get a precise trend, not precise numbers
[6/18/24, 5:16:30 AM] Rahul Modi: That’s what I am saying .. you can’t trust this data.. asking women if they have been in polygamy marriage ‎<This message was edited>
[6/18/24, 5:16:57 AM] Rahul Modi: How many will say the truth
[6/18/24, 5:16:57 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Clearly, the trend is that polygamy has reduced from 2.9 to 1.9% in M
[6/18/24, 5:17:39 AM] Rahul Modi: Had it been registered then makes more sense.. more accurate
[6/18/24, 5:18:22 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Why will they lie.. it is not a crime to have a husband with another wife in M.. that's why I said . Even if u assumed that 1.9 is low, u can assume to be ~4% which is still very low
[6/18/24, 5:18:48 AM] Rahul Modi: Not a crime but shame
[6/18/24, 5:19:00 AM] Rahul Modi: Most of the times They are being forced
[6/18/24, 5:19:48 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: What data will you get from this.. u will only get registered marriages.. u still need to validate that by surveys.. which can be flawed as per your argument
[6/18/24, 5:20:42 AM] Rahul Modi: Registered marriage are verified ones .. surveys you never know .. many factors which area you are collecting the data , age of the women etc
[6/18/24, 5:21:04 AM] Rahul Modi: Register mein why verify.. woh toh proof hoga
[6/18/24, 5:23:36 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: You can verify the number of registered marriages, not the number of women who are in a married relationship (with no proof)
[6/18/24, 5:25:37 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: And you are yourself doubting the percentage of marriages that get actually registered. So how can you even trust this data
[6/18/24, 5:26:15 AM] Rahul Modi: Register wala are more better than surveyed ones..
[6/18/24, 5:26:44 AM] Rahul Modi: Dint know they surveyed to get these results
[6/18/24, 5:27:09 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yeah sure. That's why I am saying.. assume 4% instead of 2%
[6/18/24, 5:27:46 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: The point is not the actual number, it's the actual trend. That polygamy is on the decline among all religions
[6/18/24, 5:27:47 AM] Rahul Modi: Atleast you have some proof of data.. yaha you are asking random people and don’t even know if they are lying .. chances of getting précise data is way less
[6/18/24, 5:28:44 AM] Rahul Modi: Yes compared to 30 yrs back
[6/18/24, 5:28:46 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yeah same with opinion polls.. they don't get the numbers always right, but they get the trend right almost always
[6/18/24, 5:28:58 AM] Rahul Modi: Dint happen this time
[6/18/24, 5:29:18 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: 2005-06 vs 2019-20
[6/18/24, 5:30:04 AM] Rahul Modi: Happened last 2 elections coz it was one sided
[6/18/24, 5:30:40 AM] Rahul Modi: Surveyed during covid times as well.. interesting
[6/18/24, 5:33:57 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Anyways, my point is that Muslims becoming a majority population in India is not going to happen in our lifetimes. Even crossing 20% is highly unlikely
[6/18/24, 5:35:24 AM] Rahul Modi: Again that was not the point we were trying to imply.. even if touches 20% they are always United and can shift the election results as they want
[6/18/24, 5:36:30 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: This was your point..that Hindus khatre mein hai
[6/18/24, 5:37:06 AM] Rahul Modi: If they can change the election results yes we are in danger
[6/18/24, 5:37:07 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: If 20% of Muslims can become khatra for 80% of Hindus, then i have no comments
[6/18/24, 5:37:35 AM] Rahul Modi: Getting ruled by SP and Congress again who only do appeasement politics
[6/18/24, 5:38:00 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: How is that khatra for hindus
[6/18/24, 5:38:11 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Is ur life at danger? ‎<This message was edited>
[6/18/24, 5:38:14 AM] Rahul Modi: H is currently 78% and Muslim become 20 then H number will go down more..
[6/18/24, 5:38:47 AM] Rahul Modi: Remember the terror attacks in Mumbai?
[6/18/24, 5:41:25 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Yes. So how does it relate to Hindus khatre mein hai.. it's a terrorist attack and u getting killed by that attack has no bearing on your religion
[6/18/24, 5:43:39 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: I am not debating whether BJP or Congress is better for India. I am saying that this narrative of Hindus are in danger because of population jihad is not true
[6/18/24, 5:44:50 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: BJP would have probably prevented the terrorist attack, probably not.. that's not the point. My point is landyas making 3-4 kids is not a threat to Hindus at least in our lifetimes
[6/18/24, 5:45:23 AM] Rahul Modi: You asked if my life is in danger .. yes it is when these M population can unite and chose whoever they want
[6/18/24, 5:45:47 AM] Rahul Modi: Think long term
[6/18/24, 5:46:32 AM] Rahul Modi: Look at pak and india 50 years back and now
[6/18/24, 5:48:01 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: They will choose Congress or their ally.. was ur life in danger when congress was in power? Then sure. I don't think I was in danger when congress or their ally was in power
[6/18/24, 5:48:23 AM] Rahul Modi: Coz you dint travel by train 😅
[6/18/24, 5:50:02 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: I have traveled enough times, if not daily to understand that
[6/18/24, 5:51:28 AM] Rahul Modi: It’s your perspective and it’s okay .. not arguing ..  you can like Congress or whoever you want
[6/18/24, 5:53:13 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: I don't want to argue on Congress or BJP either, just saying that Hindus khatre mein nahi hai 🙏
[6/18/24, 5:53:45 AM] Rahul Modi: As long we keep the M population in control 🙏😀
[6/18/24, 5:55:03 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Even if M cross 20% when you turn 90 😄
[6/18/24, 5:56:17 AM] Rahul Modi: Yes, will be chilling in goa with chuttam 😂

[6/19/24, 12:32:20 AM] ~ Ashutosh: They have 4 dimple at the back of their which allows them into thinking that minimum 4 babies are a necessity  .. After empowering them , those dimples will increase four fold minimum

Perfect
[6/20/24, 9:37:12 AM] Amod Tilak: Disagree. It was not a concern till 2014 coz there was no need to create divide or build votebanks till then. Changed after 2014 coz there was nothing else to win seats or get majority. 
Same way why the caste census was the center point of 2024 campaigns. 
Divide and rule.
[6/20/24, 9:38:53 AM] Amod Tilak: And by the way they may be in jail, the tailor was killed because he had a status of Nupur Sharma quotes on his WhatsApp. 
Nupur Sharma was called out by the supreme court for creating a feeling of hate and setting the country on fire by quoting something from the kuran or from the super-madarchod bullah.
[6/20/24, 9:40:25 AM] Amod Tilak: And tu Shriram hai and fir bhi randirana ke tweets share kar raha hai citing Abdul madarichod Dara hua hai. 

Naseeb gubair ke tweets nahin share Kiya tune.
[6/20/24, 9:42:04 AM] Amod Tilak: Anyways, tujhe kal bola waisa.
Darega Hindu to kuch karega Hindu and Badhega Hindustan!!
[6/20/24, 9:42:12 AM] Amod Tilak: Maa chudane gaya secularism coz the one followed in India means appeasement to the landyas.
[6/20/24, 9:47:02 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: 2014 ke pehle toh koi bola nahi ke Hindu khatre mein hai. How is it happening after modi became PM. Aisa Kya change hua ki Hindu 10 Saal ke andar darr Gaya

[6/20/24, 9:55:57 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: With this data, how do you justify that Hindu khatre mein hai or Hindu darrna chahiye?? ‎<This message was edited>
[6/20/24, 9:59:02 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Please don't trust Whatsapp university.. I agree ground reality may seem different looking at incidents in isolation, but the data gives you the whole picture of the country
[6/20/24, 10:02:07 AM] Nitish: Washington Post!! 
Waah ganne
[6/20/24, 10:02:39 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/in-last-ten-years-91-of-hate-crimes-under-modi-govt-reports-fact-checker
[6/20/24, 10:03:26 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Data is based on crime reported by media, not Washington Post
[6/20/24, 10:06:19 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: This is 2019 article
[6/20/24, 10:08:03 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Gives you an idea why M are united @12132803490
[6/20/24, 10:09:11 AM] Rahul Modi: Yes.. perfect 👍
[6/20/24, 10:09:38 AM] Pritam Khomne: Yes 👍
[6/20/24, 10:12:04 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Good 👍
[6/20/24, 10:12:16 AM] Amod Tilak: No one is trusting the WhatsApp University bhai. 
You read the news and media reports basis their intelligence. 
On that note, please help me understand, muslims everywhere but india are perpetrators, are doing crimes are vandalising. Be it Europe, be it the gulf, Africa or even the American continent. They are getting called out as the oppressed and minorities etc etc. similar is the case for the media reports about India.
[6/20/24, 10:13:46 AM] Amod Tilak: Have you ever seen a headline saying A Muslim did this or naming the perpetrators from India? It's always a girl was raped, a guy was cut in pieces etc etc without naming who commited the crime. 
But reverse the situation and the headline reads hindu person raped xyz,
Ram bhakt killed abc, etc etc etc
[6/20/24, 10:14:15 AM] Amod Tilak: But still I agree with the data you showed and why the chuslims are united.
[6/20/24, 10:14:18 AM] Amod Tilak: 👍👍
[6/20/24, 10:15:04 AM] Rahul Modi: Please also verify where this data is coming from
[6/20/24, 10:16:41 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: I agree with you that there r problems with people of that religion. And media also plays a role. I am only trying to say that this narrative of Hindus being in danger is flawed.. because it is equated to whether BJP comes to power or not
[6/20/24, 10:17:58 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Media reports bola hai article mein. Haven't mentioned further details on it
[6/20/24, 10:18:14 AM] Rahul Modi: Nice.. media reports is the source
[6/20/24, 10:18:19 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: This has data source mentioned

Hindutva chod ke moditva
[6/20/24, 10:23:01 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Pew research, hate crime watch, media reports.. these are data sources.. not Whatsapp university
[6/20/24, 10:23:31 AM] Rahul Modi: Lol.. mostly funded by western countries and come up just before elections
[6/20/24, 10:23:49 AM] Rahul Modi: Half of them are not even ther anymore
[6/20/24, 10:24:12 AM] Nitish: Unko data kaun deta hai bhai. Local media most probably
[6/20/24, 10:24:23 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Then show some independent data source from India that disproves it
[6/20/24, 10:24:53 AM] Rahul Modi: There is none and you should also not show fake data source ‎<This message was edited>
[6/20/24, 10:25:30 AM] Rahul Modi: Right now there is no independent data source which will show you true numbers
[6/20/24, 10:25:58 AM] Rahul Modi: Hate crime watch.. Kya hain ye lol

[6/20/24, 10:26:38 AM] Rahul Modi: Doesn’t even exist anymore 😂
[6/20/24, 10:32:46 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Obviously.. news is reported by media first and then police case filed before it becomes a data point
[6/20/24, 10:36:31 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: If u doubt that source, then u believe that media is very corrupt or biased. Still filing  police case filters out rumors and speculation ‎<This message was edited>
[6/20/24, 10:43:06 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: It's 5-6 year old article.. maybe they closed or changed name or got bought by another entity..don't know
[6/20/24, 11:33:29 AM] ~ Pratik: Bhai, all the data you are quoting, whether national herald, which is congress owned, the print, randi rana or Washington Post, which is very much tainted with left ideology)...sab maderchod leftist librandu hai and they are part of the same big group with only 1 intention...all these data are driven to create a wrong perception...creating wrong perception with such articles and social media is the new way in today's warfare...data is not always reliable and this is definitely far from the true ground reality 😑...you can call these gandus sino wahabi leftist...funded by china (western powers as well) to appease M along with left ideology
[6/20/24, 11:46:09 AM] Sriram Govindarajan: Ok so u r saying that data is biased because media is biased. But then why is there no alternate data to refute the original data?
[6/20/24, 11:46:55 AM] Pritam Khomne: Woh modi ne delete kar Diya

[6/20/24, 11:58:41 AM] Rahul Modi: So it’s not different than WhatsApp university 😀
[6/20/24, 12:02:26 PM] Sriram Govindarajan: This is 2019 data. Not false claims like Whatsapp university

[6/20/24, 11:29:58 PM] ~ Pratik: Indian media is notorious to project data in a certain way...why only last 2 yrs...why not last 10 yrs compared to previous 10 yrs of congress. You should get the data from the government websites directly... Only then it will be somewhat credible
