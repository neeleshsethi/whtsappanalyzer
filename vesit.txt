[6/6/23, 11:30:24 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: I am a introvert , person with low confidence not ready to come out of comfort zone n a keyboard warrior….

[6/6/23, 7:58:26 PM] Neelesh: V1 Brain Machine Interface

“One of the coolest results involved predicting a user was going to click on something before they actually did. That was a ton of work and something I’m proud of. Your pupil reacts before you click in part because you expect something will happen after you click. So you can create biofeedback with a user's brain by monitoring their eye behavior, and redesigning the UI in real time to create more of this anticipatory pupil response. It’s a crude brain computer interface via the eyes, but very cool”

[6/7/23, 11:54:26 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: I have colleagues not juniors
[6/7/23, 11:54:56 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: But I get ur mentality when you say YOUR JUNIORS
[6/7/23, 11:55:22 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: I don’t think there is much of difference u being a manager n dis manager fired
[6/7/23, 11:55:41 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Just that he is saying things loudly you say d same things in a lower voice
[6/7/23, 11:56:43 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: End of the day both of you showing d intent of being a BOSS…..
[6/7/23, 12:01:41 PM] Vinit Adkar: Haha @917400266939 kaisa laga tamacha
[6/7/23, 12:38:51 PM] Neelesh: Unfortunately when I changed my number my whys app history go deleted
[6/7/23, 12:39:09 PM] Neelesh: Else I’m pretty sure he has called ppl working under him juniors or reporters
[6/7/23, 12:39:16 PM] Neelesh: Reportees

[6/7/23, 12:56:20 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: U have always n always called them Juniors…. N reportees is a org structural term as on paper they do report their performance to you….. But again you need to understand Intent matters…… d intent with which you call Junior would be largely different from me calling one…..
[6/7/23, 12:57:10 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: U r like the Khap Panchayat mukhiya of upper caste who BELIEVES  a Harijan samaj person should always sit on d floor and not on the chair
[6/7/23, 12:57:22 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Dat speaks INTENT
[6/7/23, 12:58:04 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Even if I call someone Harijan I wont have dis intent of distance or caste behind it…

[6/7/23, 1:00:25 PM] Neelesh: And hopefully that video reaffirms my statement on desi manager
[6/7/23, 1:00:40 PM] Neelesh: I’m hitting stumps today 🙂
[6/7/23, 1:01:26 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Getting influenced and bringing to action are two different things…. Key Board Warriors speak of Influence , real
Life warriors become an influence… You know who you are
[6/7/23, 1:01:47 PM] Neelesh: Pen is mightier than sword
[6/7/23, 1:01:53 PM] Neelesh: Replace pen with keyboard
[6/7/23, 1:02:08 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: One video does not generalise d entire population…..
[6/7/23, 1:02:12 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: So makes no sense
[6/7/23, 1:02:31 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Sheee bc
[6/7/23, 1:02:58 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Completely agree…. When did you last use your pen by d way ?
[6/7/23, 1:03:20 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: I think you must have used a keyboard to order a pen as well 😂
[6/7/23, 1:03:32 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: I think this sums it up
[6/7/23, 1:03:42 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Matlab NAILED it
[6/7/23, 1:03:59 PM] Neelesh: "The pen is mightier than the sword" is a metonymic adage, indicating that the written word is more effective than violence as a means of social or political change.
[6/7/23, 1:04:02 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Straight Drives
[6/7/23, 1:04:10 PM] Neelesh: So it doesn’t matter u write with pen on keyboard
[6/7/23, 1:04:28 PM] Neelesh: Focus on intent than words
[6/7/23, 1:04:30 PM] Neelesh: Square cut
[6/7/23, 1:05:46 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: It matters *where* you write my friend…. When you write ‘ I want divorce ‘ on a piece of paper compared to a ledger paper…. It matters where
[6/7/23, 1:06:10 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Dats what I explained at d start Your INTENT
[6/7/23, 1:06:50 PM] Neelesh: Kuch bhi

[6/7/23, 1:08:06 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: N if you feel you have won I am happy for you
[6/7/23, 1:08:53 PM] Neelesh: Here’s what I mean to say
[6/7/23, 1:09:03 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: MS always says dont think abt d result …. But do the things which are in ur control and which can influence d result….. its d pressure of result dat takes to human mind…
[6/7/23, 1:09:15 PM] Neelesh: Now a days what u wrote on social media has power to influence ppl on good or bad way
[6/7/23, 1:09:27 PM] Neelesh: So don’t say that keyboard warriors are useleless
[6/7/23, 1:09:45 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Ek to ye google se nikala hai again a Copy Paste so personal opinion or skill to articulate khudka thgt…. Just borrowed
[6/7/23, 1:09:47 PM] Neelesh: Social media has big impact on ppl thinking
[6/7/23, 1:10:03 PM] Neelesh: Thts why there are bans on different trends by diff govt
[6/7/23, 1:10:03 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Completely agree
[6/7/23, 1:10:25 PM] Neelesh: So being keyboard warrior can influence change ?
[6/7/23, 1:10:28 PM] Neelesh: U agree ?
[6/7/23, 1:11:11 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Keyboard warriors who abuse are useless for me…. Who feel they have d liberty to abuse , to insult , to demotivate are FILTH…
[6/7/23, 1:11:35 PM] Neelesh: Okay then I misunderstood that term
[6/7/23, 1:11:45 PM] Neelesh: Again if I writing against govt who’s doing bad things
[6/7/23, 1:11:59 PM] Neelesh: Then ur saying I’m not keyboard warrior right
[6/7/23, 1:12:03 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Wapas wahi
[6/7/23, 1:12:14 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Are you doing this ?

[6/7/23, 1:12:44 PM] Neelesh: Okay then I got it
[6/7/23, 1:12:50 PM] Neelesh: Wasn’t aware of meaning of term
[6/7/23, 1:12:53 PM] Neelesh: Something new I learnt
[6/7/23, 1:13:44 PM] Neelesh: Excellent debate
[6/7/23, 1:13:57 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: There is no literal meaning re …. From where I read it…. From that statement key board warriors were FILTH category
[6/7/23, 1:13:59 PM] Neelesh: All allowing ppl of this group to learn something new
[6/7/23, 1:15:13 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: So Phil Jones said this on this retirement…. Through his last 4-5 years he has faced just hatred and abus from people for his injury prone fag end of career
[6/7/23, 1:16:09 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: There he said I will enjoy my retirement buy these keyboard warriors will sit on their parents porch as a heap and continue to master d art
[6/7/23, 2:43:39 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: India opt to bowl

[6/27/23, 6:19:10 PM] Vinit Adkar: Price of English players will always be highest, it is for their longevity and contributions off the field and increasing English brand

[6/27/23, 6:24:50 PM] Vinit Adkar: That’s why you have narrow minded vision of football
[6/27/23, 6:25:15 PM] Neelesh: I don’t see any reply

[7/1/23, 11:42:21 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: No fighting spirit
[7/1/23, 11:47:55 PM] Neelesh: Big day tomorrow
[7/1/23, 11:48:32 PM] Neelesh: It’s huge ask with 6 wickets left n root gone

[7/2/23, 8:43:20 AM] Neelesh: What u think @919819052580
[7/2/23, 9:01:20 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Is there any rule dat post making a catch u should hold it properly in hands for X secs aisa kuch
[7/2/23, 9:01:34 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: If dat is d case then Not Out
[7/2/23, 9:01:49 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: But if no such rule should had been given out
[7/2/23, 9:02:00 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: He took it in air complete control
[7/2/23, 9:03:02 AM] Neelesh: "Law 33.3 clearly states that a catch is only completed when the fielder has 'complete control over the ball and his/her movement'," MCC posted on Twitter. "The ball cannot touch the ground before then. In this particular incident, Mitchell Starc, was still sliding as the ball rubbed the ground, therefore he was not in control of his movement."

Former Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath had termed the decision "ridiculous" on the BBC.

"I'm sorry, that is the biggest load of rubbish I've ever seen," he said. "He's got that under control, the ball is under control. That is a disgrace. I'm sorry, that is a disgrace. I've seen everything now. I cannot believe that. That is ridiculous. If that ball is not under control, that is ridiculous."
[7/2/23, 9:03:39 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: As per Law 33.3 agree
[7/2/23, 9:03:43 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Not Out

[7/12/23, 9:29:16 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: When you go to buy a car or a house or any big ticket item you urself should calculate a contingency of 30% on upper side
[7/12/23, 9:29:38 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: This is a basic math any person will do and den go to buy

[7/12/23, 10:15:26 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Now this , isnt this known ?When you book from the app it always costs higher in package dan you buy in person… For e.g. Samosa pack in person costs 70 Rs but when booked in package costs 77 or 80 odd ‎<This message was edited>
[7/12/23, 10:15:35 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: So always prefer buying it in person
[7/12/23, 10:15:42 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: This is already known Neelesh
[7/12/23, 10:17:21 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: This reduction to 5% is not going to help us
[7/12/23, 10:19:13 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Initially say Samosa was 70 Rs which has 18% today will still cost us 70% even though gst has reduced to 5%
[7/12/23, 10:19:26 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Dats d irony 😅

[7/12/23, 10:22:37 AM] Neelesh: Price of samosa is sme , but tax kaam hai na
[7/12/23, 10:23:14 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Kiske liye
[7/12/23, 10:23:22 AM] Neelesh: At counter
[7/12/23, 10:23:26 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Overall cost of buying should reduce na
[7/12/23, 10:23:30 AM] Neelesh: When u don’t combine with ticket
[7/12/23, 10:23:34 AM] Neelesh: It will na
[7/12/23, 10:23:39 AM] Neelesh: Gst u pay

[7/12/23, 10:23:46 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Dat was less before as well
[7/12/23, 10:23:52 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Maybe % was less
[7/12/23, 10:24:00 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: But u r not getting my point
[7/12/23, 10:24:03 AM] Neelesh: That was price of samosas
[7/12/23, 10:24:08 AM] Neelesh: Now even tax will be less
[7/12/23, 10:24:18 AM] Neelesh: So price diff will be much less
[7/12/23, 10:24:22 AM] Neelesh: If u combine with ticket
[7/12/23, 10:24:28 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Initially the cost of samosa was 70Rs at counter which includes 12% GST
[7/12/23, 10:24:30 AM] Neelesh: U will have to pay gst applicable on ticket
[7/12/23, 10:24:38 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Now with GST on it reduced to 5%
[7/12/23, 10:24:51 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: The cost of samosa at counter should DIP right ?
[7/12/23, 10:24:55 AM] Neelesh: It will
[7/12/23, 10:25:13 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: It wont thats wht m saying 😅
[7/12/23, 10:25:14 AM] Neelesh: If gst has decreased
[7/12/23, 10:25:41 AM] Neelesh: With this new rule it’s not about buying samosa with app or counter
[7/12/23, 10:25:47 AM] Neelesh: It’s about if u combine with tickets
[7/12/23, 10:25:54 AM] Neelesh: U pay gst applcable for tickets
[7/12/23, 10:26:15 AM] Neelesh: Why not
[7/12/23, 10:26:24 AM] Neelesh: Doesn’t ur bill show split of cost of Samoans n gst
[7/12/23, 10:26:34 AM] Neelesh: Tht bill should have cost of samsona same n gst decreased
[7/12/23, 10:26:37 AM] Neelesh: It should drop

[7/12/23, 10:49:15 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Assuming they give the bill , many dont give and even if they give majority buy stuff during interval and its very crowded so doubt anyone will have a chance to argue

[11/4/23, 6:06:32 PM] Neelesh: Injury 🤔
[11/4/23, 6:08:01 PM] Neelesh: Play to start at 18:20 local (6:20pm). 41-over game and target is 342." So, Pakistan need 182 more from 19.3 over
[11/4/23, 6:08:51 PM] Neelesh: Pak favs now
[11/4/23, 6:09:40 PM] Neelesh: Gm @19723459802 🤣
[11/4/23, 6:31:48 PM] Neelesh: Remove sodhi .. chutiya
[11/4/23, 6:33:35 PM] Neelesh: Bccccc
[11/4/23, 6:42:21 PM] Neelesh: again. It is heavy enough to stop play. The players are going off and the covers are on. Pakistan are well ahead of the DLS par score. They had to be 179 at this stage and are ahead by 21 runs. We will keep losing overs now. All the buffer time has been used up. But Azam and Zaman are still in the dugout, they are hopeful of a quick restart. Let's see..
[11/4/23, 6:42:52 PM] Neelesh: @19723459802  feel free to set up some time with me to learn about cricket analysis
[11/4/23, 6:58:44 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: @917400266939 can you analyze and comeback why United goal was disallowed?
[11/4/23, 6:59:02 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Maguire trying to play d ball was the reason ?
[11/4/23, 6:59:11 PM] Neelesh: Not seen it
[11/4/23, 6:59:14 PM] Neelesh: Let me check
[11/4/23, 6:59:29 PM] Neelesh: Was watching sodhi get tanked
[11/4/23, 6:59:32 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Sure please take your time no rush
[11/4/23, 7:05:21 PM] Neelesh: https://x.com/_abochie/status/1720791227346391258?s=46&t=vpAJ0en1_3mpJOuybsX6-A
[11/4/23, 7:05:32 PM] Neelesh: Maguire who’s offside tries to play the ball
[11/4/23, 7:05:49 PM] Neelesh: I would be mad if it was guvwn against us
[11/4/23, 7:05:52 PM] Neelesh: Bit harsh
[11/4/23, 7:06:10 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Tries is key here
[11/4/23, 7:06:20 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Thanks dat helps
[11/4/23, 7:09:30 PM] Neelesh: 2. Offside offence
A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched* by a team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:
interfering with play by playing or touching a ball passed or touched by a team-mate or
interfering with an opponent by:
preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or
challenging an opponent for the ball or
clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or
making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball
*The first point of contact of the 'play' or 'touch' of the ball should be used
[11/4/23, 7:09:58 PM] Neelesh: I personally believe this is too ambiguous rule
[11/4/23, 7:10:21 PM] Neelesh: I think he was ruled after or condition
[11/4/23, 7:15:45 PM] Neelesh: So he tries or attempts to play the ball which distracts goal keeper, hence offsides ‎<This message was edited>

[12/3/23, 10:34:48 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Rashford is completely OUT of form right now
[12/3/23, 10:35:03 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Low on confidence and looks lost

[12/3/23, 10:36:11 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Rashford needs to put effort whole 90 play as if last
[12/3/23, 10:37:27 AM] G. Ramchandra Bane: But again you cannot expect all this from a mediocre team…. This is good for big teams like City Ars Liv Tott New Castle

[5/5/24, 10:59:28 PM] Vinit Adkar: Why Bane?

People of Chennai want him to play, he is not hampering team, they are 3rd and won IPL last year and might win again this year

It is not that he is playing for India
[5/5/24, 10:59:31 PM] Neelesh: 💯

[5/5/24, 11:03:43 PM] Vinit Adkar: There is no other keeper in Chennai squad
[5/5/24, 11:03:54 PM] Vinit Adkar: If there was one Dhoni would have stepped away
[5/5/24, 11:04:17 PM] Neelesh: Areee there may be many budding keepers
[5/5/24, 11:04:25 PM] Neelesh: That old man is taking spot
[5/5/24, 11:04:29 PM] Neelesh: Selfish Buddha
[5/5/24, 11:04:28 PM] Vinit Adkar: There are nine other teams, Dhoni is making better youngsters every year
[5/5/24, 11:04:42 PM] Neelesh: Then be a coach or mentor
[5/5/24, 11:04:45 PM] Neelesh: Don’t be in team

[5/5/24, 11:05:37 PM] Neelesh: Dhoni is there not because there are no options
[5/5/24, 11:05:38 PM] Neelesh: U know it
[5/5/24, 11:05:44 PM] Neelesh: He’s there cause he attracts crowds
[5/5/24, 11:05:46 PM] Neelesh: Sponsors
[5/5/24, 11:05:48 PM] Neelesh: Money
[5/5/24, 11:05:48 PM] Vinit Adkar: IPL is about money and building franchise

Ranji and domestic trophies should make youngsters not IPL
[5/5/24, 11:06:00 PM] Neelesh: What more can u expect from team who’s owners used to bet
[5/5/24, 11:06:31 PM] Vinit Adkar: People will say same against City as well

[5/5/24, 11:07:06 PM] Neelesh: Uska bhi mara tha
[5/5/24, 11:07:09 PM] Neelesh: Don’t even compare

[5/5/24, 11:07:54 PM] Vinit Adkar: Check how many trophies in his life he has won
[5/5/24, 11:07:56 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: A Shivam Dube gets picked picked for India from an IPL performance…. So IPL is a platform to leverage India
[5/5/24, 11:08:06 PM] Vinit Adkar: You are same as Yuvraj and Harbhajan
[5/5/24, 11:08:15 PM] Vinit Adkar: Chaddi change kar lena sone se pehle
[5/5/24, 11:08:21 PM] Vinit Adkar: Jal gaya hoga

[5/5/24, 11:08:46 PM] Neelesh: @919819052580  if u need any drinks n all this week
[5/5/24, 11:08:50 PM] Neelesh: We can go for one
[5/5/24, 11:08:52 PM] Neelesh: Not an issue
[5/5/24, 11:09:00 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Aaahe na me nahi mhanar nahi but transition is necessary
[5/5/24, 11:09:19 PM] Neelesh: We need old trafford to be fortress
[5/5/24, 11:09:21 PM] Neelesh: Bc
[5/5/24, 11:09:57 PM] Vinit Adkar: Only for T20, but he was picked when he came to Chennai because atmosphere and dressing room made him better player

Shivam Dube is 30 years old , not a youngsters 

He was going nowhere in other franchises
[5/5/24, 11:10:21 PM] Vinit Adkar: Then we can say that if not for Dhoni and Chennai he had no career
[5/5/24, 11:10:53 PM] Neelesh: He can be mentor @19723459802
[5/5/24, 11:10:58 PM] Neelesh: He can do mentorship
[5/5/24, 11:11:05 PM] Neelesh: Why he has to play on field
[5/5/24, 11:11:12 PM] Neelesh: Bc pep doesn’t play in mid field
[5/5/24, 11:11:18 PM] Neelesh: He does off the field work
[5/5/24, 11:11:22 PM] Neelesh: Ur losing this debate
[5/5/24, 11:11:31 PM] Neelesh: Please accept rather than trying to prove ur point
[5/5/24, 11:12:01 PM] Vinit Adkar: Cricket is different, he is on field coach 

Cricket mein you can win even if we pick you Sethi
Entire 11 don’t have to contribute
[5/5/24, 11:12:44 PM] Neelesh: This is shocking statement
[5/5/24, 11:12:52 PM] Neelesh: Ur Andh dhoni bhakt
[5/5/24, 11:14:12 PM] Vinit Adkar: Stats and people have proven my point, I don’t have to say anything
Thala will be Thala

And no land raj and Singh can change that
These idiots will do whatever they want just for people to notice them 

Dhoni shows up 2 months a year and still makes 10 times more money
[5/5/24, 11:14:29 PM] Vinit Adkar: And what are you Dhoni hater

[6/5/24, 11:59:11 PM] G. Ramchandra Bane: Actually
[6/6/24, 12:16:55 AM] Neelesh: There were just too many deliveries spitting up off a length on a pitch that was a minefield for the batters. Rohit was hit a few times - having to retire hurt because of the blow to his right arm. Pant took a number of blows as well, managing to just about hang in and finish it off. A tournament as big as this one deserves better pitches, and the ones at this venue so far have been disappointing to say the least. We had Sri Lanka getting bowled out for 77 a couple of days ago, and now this tod
[6/6/24, 12:16:59 AM] Neelesh: Terrible pitch

[6/27/24, 6:18:49 PM] Neelesh: Adding to the confusion is the lack of a reserve day for this match, unlike the first semifinal. "Two different playing conditions for the two different semifinals," as Mike Atherton says.
